### Example Plan
| Day | Lessons to Complete |
|-----|--------------------|

- Adjust the pace as needed. It's better to go slow and understand than to rush!

## Tips
- Take notes as you go.
- Try the code in your browser console or a Node.js environment.
- Experiment by changing values and adding your own examples.
- Review previous lessons regularly.
